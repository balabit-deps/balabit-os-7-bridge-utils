bridge-utils (1.5-11) unstable; urgency=low

  Hotplug enabled by default, integration with vlan removed.

  At package version 1.5-3 we introduced hotplug code in the code to add
  ports to the bridge as they are plugged on the system, however, at version
  1.5-4 to avoid problems with old setups we had BRIDGE_HOTPLUG=no at
  /etc/default/bridge-utils to disable the new code (see this
  bugs.debian.org/673490 for more info).

  Beginning with this release, and given the problems detected since the
  introduction of systemd, the BRIDGE_HOTPLUG default will be yes in order
  to enable the hotplug code and avoid the problems with systemd or other
  hotplug scenarios.

  If you still want the behaviour with hotplug disabled you just have to
  change BRIDGE_HOTPLUG to no at /etc/default/bridge-utils and you're done.

  On this version we've also removed integration with the vlan package,
  we're leaving vlan setup to the ifupdown package.
